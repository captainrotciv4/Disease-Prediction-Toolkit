## Project Structure

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values:** (Describe how you handled them, e.g., "Imputed with mean/median" or "Rows dropped").
- **Categorical Encoding:** (e.g., "One-Hot Encoding used for 'sex', 'chest_pain_type'").
- **Feature Scaling:** (e.g., "StandardScaler applied to numerical features like 'age', 'cholesterol'").
- **Data Splitting:** Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing sets using `train_test_split` with `stratify=y`.

### Model Training
Three classification models were trained:
- **Logistic Regression:** A linear model for binary classification.
- **Decision Tree Classifier:** A non-linear model, easily interpretable.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees for improved robustness.

### Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision:** Ability of the model to identify only relevant data points.
- ****Recall:** Ability of the model to find all relevant data points.
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC:** Measures the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visual representation of classification performance.
- **ROC Curve:** Plot illustrating the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier.


**Example Snippet for Results:**
### Logistic Regression
Accuracy: 0.85, Precision: 0.83, Recall: 0.87, F1-Score: 0.85, ROC-AUC: 0.92

### Random Forest
Accuracy: 0.90, Precision: 0.88, Recall: 0.91, F1-Score: 0.89, ROC-AUC: 0.95

*(Continue for Decision Tree)*

**Key Findings:**
- The Random Forest Classifier generally achieved the best performance across most metrics, indicating its robustness.
- (Add any other interesting insights, e.g., "Feature X was highly influential," "Class imbalance was a challenge.")

## How to Use
1. Follow the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) instructions.
2. Open `notebooks/heart_disease_prediction.ipynb` in Google Colab or your local Jupyter environment.
3. Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and generate evaluations/visualizations.
4. Modify the `data` directory with new datasets to test the toolkit on different problems.

## Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning for all models using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- Implementing more advanced models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, SVM).
- Developing a simple web interface (e.g., with Streamlit or Flask) for interactive predictions.
- Exploring explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand model decisions.
- Handling imbalanced datasets more robustly (e.g., SMOTE).
